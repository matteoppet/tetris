# Tetris game in terminal
This game is made in C, it's just a small practice project. I am using also the Turbo Conio library for windows _(credits linked on the section dedicated)_

## How to run
1. You have to compile the program: 
``` Bash
gcc main.c blocks.c map.c -o output
```

2. Run the .exe file
```Bash
./output.exe
```

_this is only if you are using the GCC compiler_

And enjoy the game!

## Contribution
Any contribution or advices are very welcome! Thank you for you time.
